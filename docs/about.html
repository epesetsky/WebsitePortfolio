    <p>Like I said, my name is Ellie and I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in only one short month. I am eager to begin my journey in the real world. The classes I've taken and internships I have experienced have led me to want to start my journey in writing. Under my writing tab on the home page you will find writing samples, including those that have been published by Pittsburgh Magazine this past summer. I look forward to what life will bring me in my next step after graduation.</p><font-family: symbol>
