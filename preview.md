Starting my preview, I knew this wouldn’t be a walk in the park for me. From day one, I was lost in the tutorials and atom. Starting from the link Ben posted on how to build a site via GitHub, I ran into the difficulty of creating a new repository. I assume I am naming it wrong? This is what I saw. 


So, from here, I decided to keep pushing forward from this issue and begin my ‘code’ for my site. As someone who does not understand this unit very well, I decided to try to pull from the tutorials we have been working on to get started on my site. I liked the way the buttons looked in “CSS Selectors”. I soon learned taking from other files proves difficult due to the linking between HTML and CSS files in the same folder. 

I am not anywhere near where I want to be with my website, but this is what it looks like so far. 

My main issue here is that I had the buttons like I had hoped for, but in attempt to remove the double words (the ‘ABOUT’, ‘WRITING’, and ‘DESIGNS’ seen above the linked form, I removed the buttons and turned them into highlighted and underlined words with a link. In this way, I moved backwards. And while on the topic of buttons, these words are linked, but go nowhere. This is obviously a problem because I want these to link to pages that have my about info, writing samples and design samples. 

This is what my HTML and CSS files look like so far. 

Obviously, a work in progress, but I am making small steps toward understanding creating a website better. From here, I am going to watch numerous Youtube videos that break down each step more simply.
